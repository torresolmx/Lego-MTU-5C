# Build your own MTU-5C!

While meeting customers, many of them told me they dreamt of building their own MTU-5C one day, and I though "Why not?".

So here it is! By following the instructions in this repository, you can build your own Lego MTU-5C!

The dimensions of this Lego model are as close as the brick dimension units allow.

Thank you to Arthur Torres for helping with suggestions to improve the build instructions.
