# Build your own MTU-5C!

While meeting customers, many of them told me they dreamt of building their own MTU-5C one day, and I though "Why not?".

So here it is! By following the instructions in this repository, you can build your own Lego MTU-5C!

The dimensions of this Lego model are as close as the brick dimension units allow.

The parts needed to build the model can be found on the [Bricklink website](https://www.bricklink.com/), which is a site where you can buy individual used lego parts. In order to make the process of ordering the required parts easier, you will find, in the "docs" folder, and XML file that you can upload as a wanted list to your bricklinks account. To upload, first log into your Bricklink account, then at the top menu, hover over the "Want" icon, and then click Upload. In that page, click "Upload BrickLink XML format", and then copy-paste the contents of the XML file. Once that you have the parts list imported, click on the "Want" logo at the top, then click "Easy Buy". This will show you the available parts that bricklink found from vendors which you can use to build this model.

Thank you to Arthur Torres for helping with suggestions to improve the build instructions.
